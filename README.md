# Project 2 the krampus attack

* Author: Elliott
* Class: Python
* Semester: winter 2023

## Overview

the program gives the user a 10 by 10 grid of blocks to press all with the 50% chance of provoking Krampus I was going to create the game to be more complicated but this was already a lot of work for me so after a minute is up the text reads that you've provoked Krampus. I used user input to click the buttons to either provoke krampus or to not. Like I said I wanted to make this more complicated but I ended up nit having enough time and not to be making excuses but the last two weeks have been pretty stressful for me in my sport swimming so this program isn't what it could be.

## Compiling and Using

The only required files are my image file and the file that has my code of course, ignore the cardbutton file as it has no purpose.

## Discussion


  * What problems did you have? What went well?  
  I had many problems since the begging with figuring out images and what all the different words meant but I'd say it went alright for the work i put in
  * What process did you go through to create the program?
  I went back testing code many times to see if it worked on sperate files and looking up guides for things I had no idea how to do.
  * What did you have to research and learn on your own?
  I learned how to use and image how to keep a image sunken and I tried to add sounds but I wasn't able to do that.
  * What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?
  mostly just small spelling mistakes but the image file wouldn't work with pythons tkinter library so I had to switch it to a gif image type
  * What parts of the project did you find challenging?
  pretty much the whole thing was really challenging
  * Is there anything that finally "clicked" for you in the process 
  how to use config when you're wrapping up a section of your code. it made a bit more sense to me
  * Is there anything that you would change about the project?
  I would want to add sound and fix the size of krampus but I was burntout from all the code and the sound just wouldn't work
  * Can you apply what you learned in this project to future projects?
  maybe but I might not use python in my future code.

## Testing

I used the play feature and tried code out on different files I tried to use some old code but I had to start from scratch, I started from a slightly less complicated block of code that just created a 10 by 10 grid that allowed you to press down the buttons and stayed pressed down. I then added a timer and imported random. I then added the image which took longer than expected and wanted to add music as well but PiP installer kept on failing on me sadly so I wasn't able to add a jumpscare sound effect. In the end the image doesn't fit in the girds block 1x1 but I'm just glad it works at all.
