# Project 2 the krampus attack

* Author: Elliott
* Class: Python
* Semester: winter 2023

## Overview

the program gives the user a 10 by 10 grid of blocks to press all with the 50% chance of provoking Krampus I was going to create the game to be more complicated but this was already a lot of work for me so after a minute is up the text reads that you've provoked Krampus.

## Compiling and Using

The only required files are my image file and the file that has my code of course

## Discussion


  * What problems did you have? What went well?  
  I had many problems since the begging with figuring out images and what all the different words meant but I'd say it went alright for the work i put in
  * What process did you go through to create the program?
  I went back testing code many times to see if it worked on sperate files and looking up guides for things I had no idea how to do.
  * What did you have to research and learn on your own?
  I learned how to use and image how to keep a image sunken and I tried to add sounds but I wasn't able to do that.
  * What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?
  mostly just small spelling mistakes but the image file wouldn't work with pythons tkinter library so I had to switch it to a gif image type
  * What parts of the project did you find challenging?
  pretty much the whole thing was really challenging
  * Is there anything that finally "clicked" for you in the process 
  how to use config when you're wrapping up a section of your code. it made a bit more sense to me
  * Is there anything that you would change about the project?
  I would want to add sound and fix the size of krampus but I was burntout from all the code and the sound just wouldn't work
  * Can you apply what you learned in this project to future projects?
  maybe but I might not use python in my future code.

## Testing

I used the play feature and tried code out on different files I tried to use some old code but I had to start from scratch
